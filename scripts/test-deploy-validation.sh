Deploy Validation Test Script
==============================

This script tests the deployment workflow validation logic without
actually creating tags or triggering deployments.

Usage:
  ./scripts/test-deploy-validation.sh        Run all validation tests
  ./scripts/test-deploy-validation.sh help   Show this help

What it tests:
  1. Normal 'just deploy' flow - tag created from main
  2. Accidental feature branch tags - should be rejected
  3. Shows the actual workflow validation logic

The script is safe to run - it only reads git state, doesn't modify anything.
